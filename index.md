## Our Defining Standards ##

### Our Mission ###
#### A High Quality Education. ####
We at First Choice Tutoring are committed to providing the highest quality education and supplementation possible. So whether we're helping a student catch-up in academics, stay on top of current material, or gain a competitive edge, we strive to help every student reach their maximum potential!

### Our Approach ###
#### Individualized Learning. ####
Every child is unique, with different learning styles and academic strengths. Some students are visual learners, while others are more auditory. Some students benefit from a lot of repetition while others only need to be shown the steps once or twice. Whichever the case may be, our tutors are trained to be flexible and responsive to their student's needs!

### Our Philosophy ###
#### No Missing Pieces. ####
It's never good when a student receives a bad grade. But it's a real shame when a student performs poorly in school because they miss an explanation, or a key bit of information isn't clarified in the proper way. At First Choice Tutoring we help provide the missing pieces in a student's education, helping them see the big picture and showing how old information relates to new topics. This will automatically lead to a better understanding of the material and better grades as well!

### One-On-One ###
#### The Power of One on One Instruction. ####
There's nothing better. To the many students who unfortunately get left behind in the classroom, tutoring in a small group may not be the answer. In this case, working one-on-one with an academic mentor who tailors the learning session to the individual student is the solution. It is only in this setting that a tutor can identify a students weak points and work  right away towards strengthening them. All our academic mentors take pride in being able to provide individualized, customized learning plans for every student they work with.
