<h3 id="about-me">About Me</h3>
<p>Hi there! I’m Abbita Yemane and I’m one of the tutors here at First Choice Tutoring! At the present moment, I’m over at Sacramento State pursuing my bachelor’s degree in Electronics Engineering. While going through school, I’ve taken subjects in the field of mathematics, physics, etc. Thanks to my family’s support, I’ve successfully maneuvered my way through school and I feel that it is my duty to now help those in need of assistance. Tutoring is something that I’ve enjoyed since the moment I started for this reason. One of my favorite sights is when you see a student who was once struggling in a certain subject begin to enjoy it! We understand that school can be challenging sometimes. We’ve all been there. What we also know is that with the proper support, some self-motivation/discipline, you can come out on the other side with your hands held up victoriously!</p>
